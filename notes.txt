todo:
    interface for adding channels easily, probably web type thing - should be last step

            if everyone ping is turned off on relay, even if its on for the relayed - it will be safe typed regardless unless both are turned on
        cross-server report messages
        
        ↓ do last ↓

        * delete if original is deleted
    semi-done // server-wide channel logs for servers
        make it display channel names not just names

        * config option for displaying redirects TO the server
        * config option for displaying reverse relays
        * button to delete messages from all servers
        * button to ban users from the relay or timeout (via role)
        * button to open to web log (future feature)
    advance network types
        * identify by unique names for easy webhook connections
